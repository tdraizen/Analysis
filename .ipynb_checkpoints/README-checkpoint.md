# Single Beta (Soros Fund)

The Soros Fund Beta calculation was.7734 so in this case, the Soros portfolio has less risk from a Beta perspective and should produce a lower
return.  Based on the mean cumulative return analysis, the consistency holds up in which the returns of Soros Fund Management was 95% of
the market returns (S$P 500).
